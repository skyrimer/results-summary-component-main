## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- use of `fetch`{.js} to read the data from json
- use of `template`{.html} to insert the similarly structured data
- use of `color-mix`{.css} to mix the colors in css. This feature is somewhat experimental, since only 75% of users will be able to see it, but it is a nice notice for the future.
